# INSURE YOUR FUTURE WITH BLOCKCHAIN

## 📄 Abstract
Blockchain has the ability to keep an incorruptible, decentralized, and transparent log of all data, makes it a technology rife for security applications. Additionally, while blockchain is transparent it is also private, concealing the identity of any individual with complex and secure codes that can protect the sensitivity of any kind of data. The decentralized nature of the technology also allows people to share the same information quickly and safely.

## 🗒️ Introduction
The insurance industry has a plenty of problems even though it is well-established and valuable - including inefficiency, fraud, human error and, most concerning of all, cyberattacks. Blockchain’s ability to create trust in a trustless ecosystem through the use of public ledgers and fortified cybersecurity protocols has positive implications for the insurance industry's future growth. In this project, Smart contracts enable blockchain users to transparently transfer anything of value without the interference of a middleman. Like physical contracts, smart contracts stipulate the rules between two parties. Unlike physical contracts, smart contracts can track insurance claims and hold both parties accountable.

## ⚙ Working
The block diagram below represents the correct working of the model. Firstly, input is taken from the users (public or government employess),then the data is saved on the blockchain network and once it is stored on the blockchain network no one can modify that data. And the policy providers can provide the policy according to the inputs given.

🔖How to run this application on your system?
 
📍 Open This Link -: <br>
📍 In order to use the Tezos smart contracts your browser must support cryptographically supported Wallets <br>
📍 For This project u can use Tezos Temple Wallet(). <br>
📍 Your Wallet must have some free ithacanet Test net Tokens. <br>
📍 After Your Wallet Is configured kindly go to Feed Insurance Page from the Home page Then enter all the Details which have been asked <br>
📍 When u click on submit button it will directly open your Tezos Wallet and will ask you to connect the wallet and then once you connect the wallet with application you need to sign that transaction. <br>
📍 Whoooo Your Insurance successfully saved on the Blockchain to verify that(For Dev purpose only) you can go to Better call dev and enter the contract address and see all the recent transactions. <br>

### 🔑 KEY FEATURES OF THE APP
- Data is stored on the blockchain network.
- Once the Insurance Records are inserted then no one can modify them.
- Safe and secure on the Blockchain Network.

### 🌈 CONCLUSION
The proposed solution is going to remove all sorts of Unfairness which sometimes done by the stuff in order to manipulate the data.

### FUTURE PROSPECT
- To make our system more useful and convinient, we plan on adding whole management data inside this blockchain Network.
